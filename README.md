### Goal
-My primary goal for this challenge was to create a functioning work day scheduler using the skills I've learned so far. I had a lot of fun with this activity. This project helped me continue learning and using my skills on JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. It also helped me discover what skills I need to polish up on. I am still struggling a little with JavaScript and Bootstrap. I feel that I have a firm grasp on HTML and CSS. I really enjoyed playing around with the CSS to make it look more appealing compared to the CSS that was provided to me. 

## Building a Responsive Website

-I was assigned with building a responsive work day scheduler with specific acceptance criteria. This assignment, I was given the majority of the HTML and CSS. I had to make the functioning JavaScript on my own. I had to add the correct links for my CSS, bootstrap, and JavaScript. 

## 
-I watched A LOT of videos on Youtube to help me figure out what my next steps were. I added the correct code to make the Date and time appear underneath the jumbotron. Then, I created ID's and containers to create the boxes inside of HTML so I could call them inside of my JS. After that, I found a unicode for a save button to add to my HTML and CSS so that I could make the button to save whatever is typed inside my boxes in my work day scheduler. Then, I wrote the code to write the hours from my Local Storage. I did hour 1 through hoyr 10. It took me a little while to figure out why the colors of the boxes weren't changing based off the time of day. I realized it's going by army time and not regular time. I had to tweak my code for it to work properly.
